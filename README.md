# Inventory, Camera Controls and Map Visualization in C++ for Unreal Engine

For an adventure strategy video game (currently in progress), worked as a freelancer helping in the creation of the first-person camera controls, inventory GUI elements controls, world setup and maps visualization for the inventoryâ€™s items management. The development was oriented to prioritize the usage of C++ over blueprints for performance and maintainability reasons through the implementation of best practices idioms and design patterns.
